## 🛠️ Getting Started

1. **Install the Extension** from the Cursor/VS Code Marketplace

4. View generated mockups, components, and wireframes
5. Fork, tweak, and paste into your project

## Can I use my own Claude Code or Cursor subscription?
Yes, after you initialise superdesign extension, some cursor/claude code rules will be added, so you can prompt the agent to do design and preview in superdesign canva (cmd + shift + p -> superdesign: open canva)

If using Cursor - I will highly suggest copy the prompt in 'design.mdc' and create a custom mode in cursor with that same system prompt; This should give you much better performance

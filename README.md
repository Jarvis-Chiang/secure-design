## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

1. **Install the Extension** from the Cursor/VS Code Marketplace
2. Open the `SecureDesign` sidebar panel
3. Type a prompt (e.g., _"Design a modern login screen"_)
4. View generated mockups, components, and wireframes
5. Fork, tweak, and paste into your project

## Using LMStudio

1. In the LMStudio `Developer` pane ensure that `Enable CORS` is turned ON in `‚öôÔ∏è Settings`
2. If the server is not running turn on the toggle next to `Status: Stopped`. Alternately launch the server from the command line with `lms server start --cors`
3. LLMs served by LMStudio will appear under `Available Models`

Make sure to select a model that supports tool calling. If you are not running LMStudio at the default URL you must configure the URL in `+ Add Model Provider` > `LMStudio`.

## Using Ollama

1. Ensure the ollama server is running with `ollama serve`
2. Ensure that the model you wanted is loaded with `ollama run <model name>`
3. LLMs served by ollama will appear under `Available Models`

Make sure to select a model that supports tool calling. If you are not running ollama at the default URL you must configure the URL in `+ Add Model Provider` > `Ollama`.

## Can I use my own Claude Code or Cursor subscription?

Yes, after you initialise securedesign extension, some cursor/claude code rules will be added, so you can prompt the agent to do design and preview in securedesign canva (cmd + shift + p -> securedesign: open canva)

If using Cursor - I will highly suggest copy the prompt in 'design.mdc' and create a custom mode in cursor with that same system prompt; This should give you much better performance

## üìÇ Where Are My Designs Stored?

Your generated designs are saved locally inside `.superdesign/`.

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Is it free and open source?**  
Yes! We are open source ‚Äî fork it, extend it, remix it.

**Can I customize the design agent?**  
Yes ‚Äî use your own prompt templates, modify behaviors, or add commands.

**Can SuperDesign update existing UI?**  
Absolutely ‚Äî select a component, describe the change, and let the agent do the rest.

## Architecture

SecureDesign follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns between the VS Code extension host, AI providers, and webview interfaces.

### Key Architectural Features

- **Modular Design**: Clear separation between extension host logic, AI providers, and UI components
- **Dependency Injection**: ServiceContainer manages service lifecycles and dependencies
- **Multi-Provider Support**: Pluggable AI provider system with unified interface
- **Tool System**: Secure file operation tools with workspace context
- **Streaming Communication**: Real-time AI responses via WebView message passing
- **Workspace Isolation**: Chat history and designs scoped per workspace
- **State Management**: Persistent state across VS Code sessions
- **Canvas Integration**: Automatic design preview and iteration workflow

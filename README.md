SuperDesign is the first **open-source design agent** that lives right inside your IDE.  
Generate UI mockups, components, and wireframes directly from natural language prompts.  
Works seamlessly with Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Code, and plain VS Code.

## üöÄ Features

- üñºÔ∏è **Product Mock**: Instantly generate full UI screens from a single prompt
- üß© **UI Components**: Create reusable components you can drop into your code
- üìù **Wireframes**: Explore low-fidelity layouts for fast iteration
- üîÅ **Fork & Iterate**: Duplicate and evolve designs easily
- üì• **Prompt-to-IDE**: Copy prompts into your favorite AI IDE (Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Code)

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

1. **Install the Extension** from the Cursor/VS Code Marketplace
2. Open the `SecureDesign` sidebar panel
3. Type a prompt (e.g., _"Design a modern login screen"_)
4. View generated mockups, components, and wireframes
5. Fork, tweak, and paste into your project

## Can I use my own Claude Code or Cursor subscription?

Yes, after you initialise securedesign extension, some cursor/claude code rules will be added, so you can prompt the agent to do design and preview in securedesign canva (cmd + shift + p -> securedesign: open canva)

If using Cursor - I will highly suggest copy the prompt in 'design.mdc' and create a custom mode in cursor with that same system prompt; This should give you much better performance

## How to run local OpenAI compatible servers?

1. Select open ai on Ai Model Provider
2. Put anything in Openai Api Key input
3. Add your OpenAi Url on the Openai Url input (example: http://127.0.0.1:1234/v1 for LM Studio)

## üìÇ Where Are My Designs Stored?

Your generated designs are saved locally inside `.superdesign/`.

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Is it free and open source?**  
Yes! We are open source ‚Äî fork it, extend it, remix it.

**Can I customize the design agent?**

**Can SuperDesign update existing UI?**  
Absolutely ‚Äî select a component, describe the change, and let the agent do the rest.

## Architecture

SecureDesign follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns between the VS Code extension host, AI providers, and webview interfaces.

### Key Architectural Features

- **Modular Design**: Clear separation between extension host logic, AI providers, and UI components
- **Dependency Injection**: ServiceContainer manages service lifecycles and dependencies
- **Multi-Provider Support**: Pluggable AI provider system with unified interface
- **Tool System**: Secure file operation tools with workspace context
- **Streaming Communication**: Real-time AI responses via WebView message passing
- **Workspace Isolation**: Chat history and designs scoped per workspace
- **State Management**: Persistent state across VS Code sessions
- **Canvas Integration**: Automatic design preview and iteration workflow
